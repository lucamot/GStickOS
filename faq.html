                    What is GStickOS?
                </h3>
                <p id="answer1" class="mt-2 text-lg hidden">GStickOS is a lightweight distribution aiming at replacing the original Game Stick 4K Lite firmware. It uses Retroarch as frontend instead of the original UI</p>

                    How do I install GStickOS?
                </h3>
                <p id="answer2" class="mt-2 text-lg hidden">To install GStickOS, download the latest image file from the website and flash it to an SD. Depending on your OS and your level of expertise there are different options to flash the image on a SD card, however if you don't know how to start try with this: <a href="https://win32diskimager.org/">Win32 disk image</a>. Be sure to have an SD card that is 2GB or more and remember that all the data on the SD will be wiped when you flash the image (there's no turning back!)</p>

                    Is GStickOS compatible with my hardware?
                </h3>
                <p id="answer3" class="mt-2 text-lg hidden">Well, it depends: I created it for my own Game Stick 4K Lite which has a Hi3798mv100 SoC with 256MB of RAM. As far as I can tell there are several versions of the same game stick and they all look almost the same but have different hardware release. You can tell you have a compatible stick if under System Information of the original firmware you have a version that says "SEGAM-M8 2024-10-15" or something similar. Provided you have a backup of your original SD you can always try using the image, it won't do any damage: if it's compatible you'll see Retroarch UI after you power it up.</p>

                    Will GStickOS makes permanent changes to my stick?
                </h3>
                <p id="answer11" class="mt-2 text-lg hidden">No. You can always revert to the original stick by replacing the SD with the original one. Everything is saved on the SD card, the stick isn't touched in any way.</p>

                    How can I update GStickOS?
                </h3>
                <p id="answer4" class="mt-2 text-lg hidden">Updates for GStickOS can be installed via our built-in update system. Simply check for updates in the settings menu and follow the prompts to keep your system up to date.</p>

                    What about games? Are there any included?
                </h3>
                <p id="answer5" class="mt-2 text-lg hidden">No, there are no ROMs included in the image: this would be a copyright violation of some sorts and you have to provide your own ROMs. There's a catch however: if you have the original SD handy you can plug it in with an USB adapter and GStickOS will try loading it: you should then see under /mnt/usb. Since there is only one USB port having a USB hub is a stronly suggested option: you can connect a self powered hub or even an unpowered one, given that you have a good power adapter the game stick will power all your peripherals without problems.</p>

                    How can I play games?
                </h3>
                <p id="answer6" class="mt-2 text-lg hidden">You need ROMs for that. To load ROMs you can plug an USB stick and it will be automatically mounted by the system, you'll find it navigating with Retroarch file browser under /mnt/sdXY. You can simply plug a vFAT formatted USB key and you should see every file you have inside there. What to load on the USB key is outside the scope of this brief FAQ, you should look at Retroarch documentation to know more about loading games, ROMs compatibility lists etc.</p>

                    Is there WiFi connection?
                </h3>
                <div id="answer7" class="mt-2 text-lg hidden">Yes, sort of: if you plug a WiFi dongle there a popular driver I built and loaded for it (RTL8188eu), if WiFi dongle has this chip you're good to go. To configure the SSID/password you have to put a wpa_supplicant.conf file in the root folder of a USB stick, plug it in and then reboot after a few seconds. GStickOS looks for wpa_supplicant.conf file in every USB device as soon as you plug it in, if it founds one it will replace the internal configuration with the one provided. This is a sample wpa_supplicant.conf file, update as needed:
                    <code><pre class="mt-2">
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
update_config=1
country=IT
network={
 ssid="my_1st_network"
 psk="MyPassword1"
}

network={
 ssid="my_2nd_network"
 psk="MyPassword1"
}
                        </pre></code>
                </div>
            </div>

                    Why this page is so ugly?
                </h3>
                <p id="answer8" class="mt-2 text-lg hidden">That's because I don't like making web pages. Seriously: it takes a lot of time to build a compelling web page and at the moment I don't have much. You'll free to contribute anyway, if you want to update it somehow let me know!</p>

                    I want to SSH into GStickOS
                </h3>
                <p id="answer12" class="mt-2 text-lg hidden">You're welcome to do so, you can login as root and the password is <code>gstickos</code>, all lower case. Beware that with root access you can do anything, even remove files that are needed for the OS to run. Anyway if you do something wrong you can flash again the image and you'll be fine.</p>

                    I want to copy some files to the SD
                </h3>
                <p id="answer13" class="mt-2 text-lg hidden">That's ok: grab yourself a program that is able to copy files over SCP (e.g. WinSCP) and use the root password above to transfer the files. My suggestion is to copy all the files under <code>/mnt/ext</code>, which is the largest partition on the SD (it's roughly the size of the SD minus 138MB). You can later see the files from the Retroarch UI by navigating again to <code>/mnt/ext</code> or wherever you put your files.</p>

                    I want to hack GStickOS
                </h3>
                <div id="answer14" class="hidden">
                    <p class="mt-2 text-lg">Fair enough, as long as you share your improvements with us :) Here are a few hints to get started:</p>
                    <ul style="list-style: circle">
                        <li>Use Linux. A virtual machine with it it's ok too. Don't use Windows, you'll regret it</li>
                        <li>GStickOS is Busybox based. This, among other things, means you have to be comfortable using the CLI</li>
                        <li>The SD is not mounted without your intervention: without being too technical, this is due to how they build the hardware of the stick and cannote be changed easily (you should flash a custom bootloader on an internal unlabelled chip, if you're into it let me know)</li>
                        <li>The SD contains two partitions: a root fs and and extended partition. To mount them you have to specify an offset to the <code>mount</code> command. The offsets you need are 10MB and 138MB. Say you want to mount the extended partition, the command is <code>sudo mount -oloop,offset=$((138 * 1024 * 1024)) /dev/sdX /media/sd</code>. Be sure to specify the correct path of the sd (i.e. replace <code>/dev/sdX</code>) and mount point (i.e. <code>/media/sd</code>)</li>
                        <li>Everything is built from scratch with a custom toolchain, from the base OS (Busybox) to Retroarch and its cores. I made a docker image of the toolchain (<a href="https://github.com/lucamot/HiSTBLinuxV100R005C00SPC050">here</a>) with wich you should be able to recompile everything, kernel included. A word of warning: using toolchains is the first step down the rabbit hole. My only clue here is that after you load the docker image you should source the <code>env.sh</code> file.</li>
                        <li>Most cores build without modification: this mean that if you have your docker container running (and <code>env.sh</code> sourced) you should be able to just <code>make</code> them all. Some of them require small to big changes though, from updating some configurations to recompiling libraries and frameworks.</li>
                        <li>It's easy to be stuck with the toolchain, especially because it's based on an older GCC (4.9.2) and the equivalent glibc. Reach the Discord channel if you want to ask questions, I'm not always there but I can try answer your questions.</li>
                    </ul>
